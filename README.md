# basic_chat_firebase

 Introduction

This is a basic real-time chat application built using Firebase as the backend to store and retrieve messages. The UI runs on a local server using Node.js.

Currently, the app is set up to run on localhost, so only users connected to the same local network as the host can access it.

 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
	â€¢	Node.js and npm

How to Run

Clone the repository and open a terminal.

Navigate to the src folder:
 cd src

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

 Note

This app currently works only over localhost or local network. For public access, consider deploying it using Firebase Hosting or services like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
